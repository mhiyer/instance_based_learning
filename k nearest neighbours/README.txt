README

This section contains codes related to k-nearest neighbours using python3
Scipy is not used to generate models.
They are created from scratch using pandas, numpy and math libraries. 
Plotnine- the python version of ggplot (or 'a' python version of ggplot, if you prefer another ggplot variant, you could modify the code accordingly ) - is used for plotting misclassifications.
